## OCalc

This program simply builds an interactive CLI calculator and was written in order for me to learn about lexers and parsers by handwriting them.

### Build instructions

**Requirements**:

  `opam` >= 1.2

  `ocaml` >= 4.05.0

  The following libraries:
  `alcotest`


**Instructions**:

`make run` to try out the calculator (exit by typing *EXIT*)

`make test` to run tests


**To do**:

- add more unit tests for lexing and parsing stages

- randomise test input
